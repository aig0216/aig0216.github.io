I'm a masters student in the Department of Geography at the University of Nevada Reno. My areas of interest are snow and forest interactions, light-absorbing particles on snow, and snow and glacial melt due to a changing climate.  I am currently working on a 2 year field project studying snow albedo in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range in California.
