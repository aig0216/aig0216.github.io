## Current Projects

**Snow and Forest Interactions: Snow albedo in a temperate coniferous forest**

Collaborators: Dr. Anne Nolin, Dr. Stephen Drake, Dr. Keith Jennings, Dr. Monica Arienzo, Dr. Kenneth Nussear

Funding: University of Nevada Reno College of Arts & Sciences

Years: (2018 - Present)

Snow in forested regions is essential to surrounding ecosystems and downstream users. Studying snow and forest interactions is essential to understand how snow accumulates and melts in forests. At Sagehen Creek Field Site in the Sierra Nevada, we measured snow albedo, snow impurities, and the snowpack energy balance for the Water Year of 2019.

**NASA SnowEx**

Collaborators: Dr. Anne Nolin

Funding: NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program

Years: (2019 - Present)

SnowEx is a five year program initiated and funded by NASA THP to address the most important gaps in snow remote sensing knowledge. It focuses on airborne campaigns and field work, and on comparing the various sensing technologies, from the mature to the more experimental, in globally-representative types of snow. The goal is to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission.

## Old Projects

**Cordillera Blanca, Cordillera Vilcanota Peru, American Climber Science Program**

Collaborators: Dr. Carl Schmitt, Dr. John All, Willmer Sanchez Rodriguez

Funding: National Science Foundation, United State Antarctic Program

Years: (2016) & (2018)

The American Climber Science Program (ACSP) is a non-profit organization that conduct and facilitate research and conservation in remote and mountain environments. The ACSP has been working in the mountain ranges of Peru for 10 years studying the impacts of human use and climate change on the fragile mountain environments.

**Light-absorbing Particles in the Snowy Range, Wyoming, University of Wyoming**

Collaborators: Dr. Carl Schmitt, Dr. David Williams, William Bowers

Funding: University of Wyoming, Haub School Creative Activities Grant, McNair Scholars

Years: (2016-2017) & (2017-2018)

The Snowy Range in south-central Wyoming is a northern extension of the Colorado Rockies and is subjected to extreme wind and snow events in the winter months. The mountain range is surrounded by very few contributing sources of light-absorbing particles. This study measured snow for concentrations of black carbon in the Water Years of 2017 and 2018. Results showed average North American values of black carbon, dust.

**Interdisciplinary Climate Change Expedition, ICCE, Wind River Range Wyoming, Central Wyoming College**

Collaborators: Dr. Carl Schmitt, Jackie Klancher, Darren Wells,

Funding: Wyoming EPSCoR - National Science Foundation, Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics, Wyoming NASA Space Grant Consortium, Central Wyoming College   

Years: (2014) & (2015)

The ICCE expedition has been traveling to the remote glaciers in the Wind River Range every summer since 2014. Their work focuses on studying the impacts of humans and climate change on fragile alpine environments. Interdisciplinary science teams use varieties of methods and field projects to study glacial recession and hydrology.
