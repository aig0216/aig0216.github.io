## Current Projects

**Snow and Forest Interactions: Snow albedo in a temperate coniferous forest**

Collaborators: Dr. Anne Nolin, Dr. Stephen Drake, Dr. Keith Jennings, Dr. Monica Arienzo, Dr. Kenneth Nussear

Funding: University of Nevada Reno College of Arts & Sciences

Years: (2018 - Present)

The Willamette INFEWS project is a research effort, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation and led by Oregon State University.  The project focuses on the Willamette River Basin, a 11,600 mi2 (30,000 km2) watershed with diverse land use and a history of intensive study and integrated modeling.  Within the context of this basin, this project asks: What are the tradeoffs and adaptation pathways that will help us satisfy competing ecological demands while also securing food, water and energy for a growing population?

**NASA SnowEx**

Collaborators: Dr. Anne Nolin

Funding: NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program

Years: (2019 - Present)

SnowEx is a five year program initiated and funded by NASA THP to address the most important gaps in snow remote sensing knowledge. It focuses on airborne campaigns and field work, and on comparing the various sensing technologies, from the mature to the more experimental, in globally-representative types of snow. The goal is to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission.

## Old Projects

**McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antartica Stream Team, MCM LTER**

Collaborators: Dr. Dian McKnight, Dr. Michael Gooseff, Zach Sudman

Funding: National Science Foundation, United State Antarctic Program

Years: (2015-2016) & (2016-2017)

The McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER project is an interdisciplinary study of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in a cold desert region of Antarctica. In 1992 this area was selected as a study site within the National Science Foundation's Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.
